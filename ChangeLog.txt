Change Log
==========

vs. contributed code base: `astgen_2009-05-15`

CR000 Various stylistic and minor changes, e.g. `StringBuffer` -> `StringBuilder`, etc.

CR001 Code for generation of field setter methods added; make nodes modifyable

CR002 Remove hard-coded runtime dependency to edu.rice.cs.plt from generated code. As a 
consequence an appropriate import should be added to the AST definition file.

CR003 Added new `DeepCopyVisitorGenerator`

CR004 Remove generated-at date from header comment of generated classes because it forces a 
useless new svn version on every generation run, absent substantial changes.
