# kmw-astgen

This is a slightly modified and enhanced version of ASTGen - a Java tool for generating heterogeneous class hierachries
and their visitors from a simple textual definition.

The original public version dated 2005-05-20 can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/astgen/).
Our code, however, is based on a later version dated 2009-05-15, which we have recovered from a source jar distributed
with [Project Fortress](http://java.net/projects/projectfortress/sources/sources/show).

The original software and our changes and additions are licensed under a BSD License (see LICENSE.txt).
