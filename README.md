# kmw-astgen

This is a slightly modified and modernized fork of ASTGen - a Java tool for generating heterogeneous class hierachries and their visitors from a simple textual definition. ASTGen can be employed to generate Java source code used for building Abstract Syntax Trees.

The original public version dated 2005-05-20 can be found [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/astgen/).
Our code, however, is based on a later version dated 2009-05-15, which we have recovered from a source jar distributed with [Project Fortress](http://java.net/projects/projectfortress/sources/sources/show).

Both the original software and our modifications are licensed under a BSD License (see LICENSE.txt).
